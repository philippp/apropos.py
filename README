Deep, dirty, and exhaustive 'apropos' for Python. Crawls all 
libraries in the system.path, and matches a querystring against
all module names, as well as class, function, and method names 
and docstrings of the top-level modules.

Usage: ./apropos.py <keyword/regex>

This module was created due to the limits of PyDoc's apropos
method, which fails hard when one of the top level modules cannot
be imported. The native apropos method also does not crawl
docstrings, or deep module names, which this module does.
